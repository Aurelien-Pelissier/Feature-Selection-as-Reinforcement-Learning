# Feature-Selection-as-Reinforcement-Learning

Bandit based Reinforcement Learning applied on Feature selection, using improved UCT Algorithm
This code is an implementation of the algorithm described in (https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00484049/document). The algorithm is based on bandit reinforcement learning, and is an improved version of UCT
